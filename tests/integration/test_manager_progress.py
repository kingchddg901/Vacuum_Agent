"""Tests for core/manager.py::get_job_progress_snapshot — the live job engine.

~150 lines of real logic (timeline estimate/reanchor, current-room derivation,
bounds-exit + stall detection) that the dashboard polls. Driven against the
real manager + a wired LearningManager with seeded active-job state.

Coverage targets
----------------
[PR-1]  idle job → terminal snapshot, empty timeline.
[PR-2]  started job + learning + resolved rooms → snapshot with derived current
        room and a timeline.
[PR-3]  completed rooms → the reanchor timeline branch.
[PR-4]  a long-overrun current room → awaiting_bounds_exit / stall signalling.
